PEP 8 is the official Python style guide. It provides coding conventions and recommendations for how to write clear, readable Python code.

Some key elements of PEP 8:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation, not tabs
- Limit lines to 79 characters maximum
- Use lowercase with underscores for variable and function names
- Use CapWords convention for class names
- Use two blank lines between top-level definitions, one blank line between methods
- Use spaces around operators and after commas in argument lists
- Docstrings for modules, functions, classes, and methods
- Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines

Following PEP 8 makes Python code more consistent and easier to read/maintain. Many Python projects and organizations adhere to PEP 8 as their official coding style. There are also PEP 8 linter tools that can check code for compliance automatically.

So in summary, PEP 8 contains Python's official guidelines for style and best practices when writing code. It helps create uniformity across Python projects.
